Needed for 1.0
--------------

 - check that all public but unstable API is properly guard off with
   I_KNOW_THIS_API_IS_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE_ETC

 - rethink actions shipped with PolicyKit; we probably just want something
   very simple that only applies to the local authority backend
   - some mechanisms don't run as root - how should they convey that
     they are authorized to check authorizations?

 - man page review / section review

 - review/restrict symbol visibility in shared libraries

 - check / validate all incoming arguments
   - includes all D-Bus interfaces and public library API
   - validate D-Bus object paths everywhere
   - ...and other security/paranoia stuff

 - make sure library API is reasonably MT-safe

 - avoid watching all name owner changes in PolkitBackendAuthority and
   PolkitBackendServer; remove the name-owner-changed vfunc

GNOME Authentication Agent
--------------------------

 - maybe expand on the notification icon so it is more detailed
   what temporary authorizations the session has - and maybe a way
   to only drop some of them
